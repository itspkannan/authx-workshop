# 🔐 AuthX Workshop

Welcome to **AuthX Workshop** — a hands-on project series focused on understanding and implementing **OAuth 2.0** and **OpenID Connect (OIDC)** using **Keycloak** as the Identity Provider.

## 🎯 Goal

The primary goal of this workshop is to:

- Learn the core concepts of OAuth2 and OIDC.
- Build practical, real-world authentication and authorization projects.
- Explore how different OAuth2 flows work (Authorization Code, Client Credentials, etc.).
- Understand role-based access control (RBAC), scopes, and token validation.
- Integrate Keycloak with various app types including SPAs, backend APIs, microservices, and infrastructure components.

## 📦 What's Included

This repo contains multiple mini-projects and use cases:
- 🔑 Authorization Code Flow with PKCE for SPAs
- 🔐 Backend API protection using OAuth2 Bearer tokens
- 🗂️ File sharing app with RBAC using Keycloak roles
- 🏢 Multi-tenant SaaS simulation using Keycloak realms
- 🚪 Keycloak-admin dashboard with REST API integration
- 🌐 Social Login via federated identity providers (Google, GitHub)
- 📡 Secure API Gateway for microservices using access tokens
- ☁️ Kubernetes OIDC login using Keycloak

Each project is self-contained with its own `README`, Docker setup, and Keycloak configuration scripts.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Identity Provider**: Keycloak (via Docker)
- **Languages**: Python (FastAPI/Flask), Java (Spring Boot), JavaScript (React)
- **Security**: OAuth2.0, OIDC, JWT, Role-based access control
